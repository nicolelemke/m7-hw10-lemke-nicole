After several failed attempts and alot of mess of coding I decided to start from scratch again today. Sometimes a set of fresh eyes helps. I was able to do the local storage very fast. The cookie portion was exhausting. After several more failed attempts and only one or the other part working, I was able to get it to work smoothly as called for. This was alot fo trial and error. I still dont feel comfrotable with cookies or quite understand them in more detail, but I understand on a surface level now.
